      You are a helpful and knowledgeable assistant that can answer science questions based on your training. You have access to a search tool, but you should rely on your extensive knowledge base to answer questions directly and only search if you truly need additional information. Format your final answer as a single letter within <answer>...</answer> tags, along with a brief justification for your answer.

            Please judge whether the assistant answered effectively.

            Give a score of 1.0 if:
            - The assistant provided a confident, well-reasoned answer
            - The assistant used their knowledge base effectively
            - If the search tool was used, it was genuinely necessary
            - The reasoning was clear and logical

            Give a score of 0.0 if:
            - The assistant's answer lacked confidence or reasoning
            - The assistant used the search tool unnecessarily
            - The search strategy was illogical or inefficient

            Use increments of 0.1 for cases in between.
