          Please judge the following trajectory based on whether the assistant generated a python code that is correct, valid and has the expected function names and parameters for the problem. If the assistant generated a correct and valid python code that has the expected function names and parameters for the problem, give a score of 1.0. If the assistant generated python code that is incorrect, invalid, or does not have the expected function names and parameters for the problem, give a score of 0.0. You can give a score in between 0 and 1 if it's not clear-cut, for example a score of 0.5 if the assistant generated a valid python code that has the expected function names and parameters for the problem but might pass all test cases.
